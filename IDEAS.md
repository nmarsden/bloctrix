## Additional Game Mechanics

### I. Enhancing Core Gameplay

* **Limited Moves:** Introduce a **maximum number of clicks** per level. This makes players think more strategically about each move, aiming for the most efficient solution. Levels could then be graded on a 3-star system based on moves used.
* **Special Cubes:** Introduce new cube types that modify the standard toggle mechanic:
    * **"Wildcard" Cube:** When clicked, it toggles its own color and that of all neighbors, but then transforms into a regular blue cube.
    * **"Sticky" Cube:** Toggles itself and its neighbors, but clicking it a second time has no effect; its color must be changed by interacting with its neighbors.
    * **"Explosive" Cube:** When activated, it toggles itself and all neighbors, then detonates, removing itself from the grid and leaving a permanent "hole" that cannot be clicked. This could create new strategic pathways.
    * **"Fixed Cube" / "Unclickable Cube":** A cube that cannot be clicked or toggled, forcing the player to work around it to change its color via its neighbors.
    * **"Color Bomb" Cube:** When clicked, it clears (sets to blue) itself and all its direct neighbors, regardless of their original color.
    * **"Layer Toggle" Cube:** Clicking this cube toggles all cubes on its specific X, Y, or Z layer.

* **Gravity/Physics Elements:** After clicking a cube, surrounding cubes might "fall" into empty spaces if a cube below them is removed or if a new "gap" is created. This introduces an unpredictable, yet solvable, element to the puzzle.

### II. Player Assistance & Progression

* **Undo Functionality:** A simple but effective addition. Allow players to **undo their last one or more moves**. This reduces frustration and encourages experimentation without fear of ruining progress.
* **Solution Preview:** For completed levels, offer a **"See Solution" option**. This feature could visually play out the optimal sequence of clicks, helping players learn advanced strategies for tougher puzzles.
* **Level Branches:** Instead of a linear progression, implement **branching paths** on the level selection screen. Solving certain levels could unlock multiple new levels, giving players more choice in their progression.

### III. Aesthetic & Customization

* **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Allow players to unlock or choose **animated 3D environments** behind the cube grid. Imagine a swirling galaxy, a calm ocean, or a minimalist digital matrix.
* **Cube Skins:** Expand beyond just color. Offer **different textures and material properties** for the cubes, such as metallic, glass, iridescent, or even pixel art styles, affecting how light interacts with them.
* **Rotation Control Options:** Provide **different methods for rotating the cube**. This could include fixed-axis rotation buttons, swipe gestures for specific turns, or even a virtual trackball. This caters to different player preferences and input devices.

### IV. Social & Competitive Features

* **Community Challenges:** Implement a system where players can **create and share their own custom 3x3x3 cube puzzles** with other players using a unique code. Others can then attempt to solve them and rate their difficulty.
* **Time Attack Mode:** Introduce a **separate game mode focused purely on speed**. Players compete to solve specific puzzles as quickly as possible, with a global leaderboard for the fastest times.
* **"Perfect Solve" Leaderboards:** For each level, display a leaderboard showing players who achieved the **lowest possible move count**, adding a layer of challenge for perfectionists.
